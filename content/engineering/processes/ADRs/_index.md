## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) template

This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) - Michael Nygard. You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing the ADR files.

In each ADR file, write these sections:

```
# Title

## Status
- What is the status (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded etc.)?

## Context
- What is the issue that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
- What is the change that we are proposing and/or implementing?

## Consequences
- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```
