description: General info about API resources running through Azure Cloud Provider
---

## General Architecture
There is a Windows VM which has been deployed which acts as a resource to run the POS API. On this VM we are able to start the POS test server  
which the client uses to send and receive data from.

### HungerRush Handheld Infrastructure

This [repository](https://github.com/IIIMPACT/hungerrush-handheld-infrastructure) represents the IaC for the HungerRush Handheld project and is built and maintained in Terraform.
You can also login into Azure portal using the **iciuser@devrevention.onmicrosoft.com** (password can be obtained from an active dev) to view the deployed resources.
These resources should not be modified via Azure portal directly, they must be changed via Infrastructure as Code using Terraform. 

### Connecting to the Windows VW
In order to restart the POS test server the following 2 application are used:

- **Teamviewer** -> connect file transfer with id **953 138 928** (Teamviewer session & Windows VM passwords can be obtained from any of the active developers)
- **Microsoft Remote Desktop** (requires VPN, needs fixing since we currently don't have VPN access anymore)

### Solutions Overview

There are 12 solution in RevCloudPOS of which some are more relevant than others: 
- **DataService** defines the main data services that we use frequently on the POS client 
- **RevCloudPos** is a shared project for POS services
- **RevCloudPos.Android** is the sample Android Project
- **RevCloudPos.IOS** is the sample IOS Project
- **RevCloudPos.UWP** is the sample Windows App
- Multiple **HurgerRushPOS** type solutions for different platforms are older and we don't use them actively

### Building & Integrating Solutions

In order to build & integrate solutions you need to:
- Select property on the e.g. DataService
- Select Class Library as type
- Select >  .NET 2.0 version in order for Xamarin to be compatible with the libraries
- Go to the output in DataService/bin/Debug(or Release)/netstandart2.0 to find the DataService.dll
- This DataService.dll can then be integrated into the Hand Held client
