### Domain

# Introduction


The domain describes a model which represents our current understanding of the HungerRush project area. This model
includes a Ubiquitous Language definition with which we communicate, both internally and with domain experts and the
client directly. 

For a justification of the ubiquitous language, see
[Martin Fowler's justification](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html)

## Adding new ubiquitous language

Use the following command to create a new document correctly, using Hugo's archetypes.

```shell
hugo new domain/some-new-term.md
```
