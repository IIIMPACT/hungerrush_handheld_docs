### TESTING PHASES

***

#### Analysis

* QA (and stakeholders) analyse past, present and future user stories
* Identify testable requirements
* Extract Acceptance Criteria and compare against project Roadmap
* Create tests to cover all positive / negative scenarios and edge cases

#### Strategy

**NEW FEATURE TESTING**

* Occurs once all the tasks of a story are completed by developers
* When QA team has capacity to validate the ticket
* Tested on multiple devices, operating systems and browsers (where possible / necessary)

**REGRESSION TESTING**

* Divided among available QA team members and run according to schedule
* Maximise coverage and tested on multiple devices, operating systems and browsers (where possible / necessary)
* Any defects discovered are raised, given a priority based on their severity and communicated with the team in relevant channels

**EXPLORATORY TESTING**

* Forms a vital part of our strategy
* Conducted in an ad hoc format on a regular basis, when time permits
* Tested on multiple devices, operating systems and browsers (where possible / necessary)
* Find defects not observed during regular test activities
