### TEST CASE DEVELOPMENT

***

QA will create test scenarios that can be run against different user types, products / services, environments, devices etc.

Test cases should provide sufficient detail to cover acceptance criteria and include the following for each scenario:

* TITLE relating to the story, sub-task or action
* LINKED to a correlating story or sub-task
* PRIORITISED correctly with P0-P3 rating
* EVIDENCED correctly with ticket comment, visual aids etc…
* ESTIMATED run time added after execution
* LABELLED correctly

**REVIEW**  
Once a test case or pack of test cases is complete, this should be assigned to another QA member to review:

* The status should change from ‘Draft’ to ‘Review’ when ready for review
* Once checked, change the status to ‘Approved’ and inform the QA team that the test case is ready for execution

**COVERAGE**

* All major business flows executed successfully
* Complete functional coverage
* All critical test cases are passed
* Accepted failure rate of 5% for low priority test cases
