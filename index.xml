Primary QA objectives shall include but are not limited to:
Unpacking business requirements during planning sessions Creating QA related test plans and onboarding documentation Design and execute test cases Plan and create test runs Identify issues and troubleshooting Track and report defects Make suggestions to enhance the user experience Attend product related meetings Refine and optimise workflows Report to product owners and / or business stakeholders</description></item><item><title>API resources</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/systems/api-resources/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 16:05:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/systems/api-resources/</guid><description>General Architecture There is a Windows VM which has been deployed which acts as a resource to run the POS API. On this VM we are able to start the POS test server
which the client uses to send and receive data from.

Azure workflow steps are created on Azure Devops and the yaml config file is maintained on there Developers write unit tests Code changes are committed to GitHub Developers create a pull request on GitHub The following Azure pipelines are triggered for changes on the development branch Code Style which runs a Sonar linting code analysis (required workflow) the Sonar linting account to view the linting reports for this project can be accessed using the iciuser@devrevention.</description></item><item><title>POS Setup</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/systems/pos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 16:05:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/systems/pos/</guid><description>HARDWARE Prerequisites Make sure you have the right POS device.

They are redundant and should be removed.
Some popular noise words are:
The (prefix)
Info
Data
Variable
Object
Manager
If your class is named UserInfo, you can just remove the Info and make it User. Using BookData instead of Book as class name is just a no-brainer, as a class stores Data anyways.</description></item><item><title>Development Processes</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/development-flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:10:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/development-flow/</guid><description>Git We follow a gitflow like strategy.

Setup for new members navigate to root directory where we have the .SLN file and .git folder
run npm install
Fresh setup Pre-requisites 1. Install node on your computer -&amp;gt;, and make sure it’s available in your terminal by running node -v
2. Install dotnet cli -&amp;gt; and make sure it’s available by running dotnet -v
3. Then, install dotnet format -&amp;gt; : dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format which helps format C# code in dotnet projects</description></item><item><title>Test Case Development</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/quality-assurance/test-case-development/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/quality-assurance/test-case-development/</guid><description>TEST CASE DEVELOPMENT QA will create test scenarios that can be run against different user types, products / services, environments, devices etc.
Test cases should provide sufficient detail to cover acceptance criteria and include the following for each scenario:
TITLE relating to the story, sub-task or action LINKED to a correlating story or sub-task PRIORITISED correctly with P0-P3 rating EVIDENCED correctly with ticket comment, visual aids etc… ESTIMATED run time added after execution LABELLED correctly REVIEW</description></item><item><title>Defect handling</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/quality-assurance/defect-handling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/quality-assurance/defect-handling/</guid><description>DEFECT HANDLING When an issue is observed the QA team should:
Make sure the issue is reproducible Get another team member to verify Raise necessary bug ticket and share with the team Bug prioritisation should follow the below rating system, which takes into account how severely the bug impacts the system and how urgently it should be fixed / eradicated from the site. If necessary QA should consult a developer or PO to make sure the correct priority is given.</description></item><item><title>Testing</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/test-coverage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:11:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/test-coverage/</guid><description>At IIIMPACT, we require that all work has a unit test coverage of at least 70%. This is a minimum however, all code should be covered to a level which considers all critical and functional components.
Your project should stipulate the test tech stack and the minimum coverage required.</description></item><item><title>Technical Incidents</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/incidents/technical-incidents/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 12:30:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/incidents/technical-incidents/</guid><description>Technical Incidents Priority Codes These are largely defined from this resource, but adapted for our use-case:

This is because we have tried to use language which makes sense in the context of each domain, or matches industry standard language.
Site The term &amp;ldquo;Site&amp;rdquo; refers to a single restaurant chain managed by a Customer. As a Customer, I can manage multiple restaurant chains under a single account.
A site is analogous to a merchant.</description></item></channel></rss>
