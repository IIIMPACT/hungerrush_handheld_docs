On this VM we are able to start the POS test server
which the client uses to send and receive data from.
HungerRush Handheld Infrastructure This repository represents the IaC for the HungerRush Handheld project and is built and maintained in Terraform.

Azure workflow steps are created on Azure Devops and the yaml config file is maintained on there Developers write unit tests Code changes are committed to GitHub Developers create a pull request on GitHub Azure pipelines are triggered for changes on the development branch If any tests fail the code should not be merged into another branch The apk that is build and signed on the container on Azure Devops is distributed to the app center</description></item><item><title>POS Setup</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/systems/pos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 16:05:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/systems/pos/</guid><description>HARDWARE Prerequisites Make sure you have the right POS device. Hera51 If POS device isn&amp;rsquo;t available, an Android phone is fine for testing. Operating System Ensure the device runs Android Nougat (version 7.1.0 or higher)
Platform Repositories Hungerrush-handheld-order-and-pay This represents the POS app. Weâ€™ve followed a an MMVM approach in the implementation of this app.

Currently, these are common to both customers and consumers. This will likely be refined when this work is planned out further.
Docket The term &amp;ldquo;Docket&amp;rdquo; refers to all information relating to an open table or a consumer order, that is relevant to the consumer themselves. A docket does not include information that is only relevant to the kitchen,
A docket typically includes information such as:</description></item><item><title>Code Styles</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/adrs/code-styles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:05:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/adrs/code-styles/</guid><description>Status proposed Context We need a structed set of rules to define how we go about code styling/formating Decision Using Sonar Cloud in our CI &amp;amp; Local Linting process to enforce code styles in the HandHeld Codebase Using ReSharper/Rider for local linting and formating Consequences Formatting and linting will be enforced in the CI process using Sonar linting for detecting coding issues in real-time and get clear guidance on how to fix them.</description></item><item><title>Naming Convention Guidelines</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/guides/naming-guideline/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:11:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/guides/naming-guideline/</guid><description>Naming Guidelines Avoid Noise Words Noise words are the words that do not offer any additional information about the variable. They are redundant and should be removed.
Some popular noise words are:
The (prefix)
Info
Data
Variable
Object
Manager
If your class is named UserInfo, you can just remove the Info and make it User. Using BookData instead of Book as class name is just a no-brainer, as a class stores Data anyways.</description></item><item><title>Development Processes</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/development-flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:10:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/development-flow/</guid><description>Git We follow a gitflow like strategy. All changes are made in branches based off of master Branches are merged into master via PR Frontend applications are deployed to individual sandbox environments for each pull request. Frontend applications are automatically deployed to staging when merging to main Backend applications are deployed to a dedicated staging environment when being merged to master Backend applications are deployed to production when invoking the release workflow We use strict semantic versioning on all packages.</description></item><item><title>Test Server Setup</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/systems/server/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 16:05:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/systems/server/</guid><description>HungerRush Server (SandBox environment) Prerequisites On a windows server machine, make sure you have these installed.

Setup for new members navigate to root directory where we have the .SLN file and .git folder
run npm install
Fresh setup Pre-requisites 1. Install node on your computer -&amp;gt;, and make sure itâ€™s available in your terminal by running node -v
2. Install dotnet cli -&amp;gt; and make sure itâ€™s available by running dotnet -v
3. Then, install dotnet format -&amp;gt; : dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format which helps format C# code in dotnet projects</description></item><item><title>Test Coverage</title><link>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/test-coverage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:11:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://iiimpact.github.io/hungerrush_handheld_docs/engineering/processes/test-coverage/</guid><description>At IIIMPACT, we require that all work has a unit test coverage of at least 70%.

This is because we have tried to use language which makes sense in the context of each domain, or matches industry standard language.
Site The term &amp;ldquo;Site&amp;rdquo; refers to a single restaurant chain managed by a Customer. As a Customer, I can manage multiple restaurant chains under a single account.
A site is analogous to a merchant.</description></item></channel></rss>
